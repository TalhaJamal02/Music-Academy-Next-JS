# Music Academy
This **Music Academy** website is a demonstration of my **web development** skills, built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **AceternityUI**. The design showcases a clean, responsive interface, highlighting various sections such as courses, instructors, and events. It is intended to provide a smooth and engaging user experience, focusing on modern design principles and efficient navigation. This project serves as a portfolio piece to illustrate my ability to create visually appealing and functional websites, perfect for any professional setting.
